# Cursor Rules
This notebook is a clone of a live analysis notebook on the All of Us researcher workbench, and therefore, none of the code will actually be ran within this notebook.
- All updates on code outputs will be copy and pasted into the chat/editor manually. 
- The resources in the dataproc cluster used to run these analysis will default to:
* 4 CPUs, 15GB of RAM
* 2 workers (+additional preemptible workers if needed), 4 CPUs (can use more if needed) 
The standard disk used for the master node is 150GB by default, can adjust if need be. 
- Each notebook (in /gs/gsfs0/shared-lab/greally-lab/David/GA4K/6_AoU-AxA/notebooks) builds upon the outputs and files generated by the previous.
- No emojis in code
- Be wary of the memory usage when processing files as wwe a re dealing with data wrangling hundreds of thousands of samples worth of genotypes.
