# Cursor Rules
This notebook is a clone of a live analysis notebook on the All of Us researcher workbench, and therefore, none of the code will actually be ran within this notebook.
- All updates on code outputs will be copy and pasted into the chat/editor manually. 
- Each notebook (in /gs/gsfs0/shared-lab/greally-lab/David/GA4K/6_AoU-AxA/notebooks) builds upon the outputs and files generated by the previous.
